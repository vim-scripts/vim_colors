These are 4 themes I made which I prefer for programming, pyte.vim for example is a light and clear one which uses italic mode for pronouncing something, quite fun when programming python (or any other language).
The color-themes will be readably in the console I suppose (since I stole parts from other themes), but are intended to use with a gui such as gvim.
